## üöÄ Real-Time Location Tracker

### Overview üåç
This project is a real-time location tracking system designed to track users' movements from one location to another. It's ideal for applications similar to those used by Ola, Uber, Zomato, Swiggy, and other services that require precise and efficient location tracking. The system provides accurate real-time updates and optimized routing, making it highly effective for location-based services.

### Features ‚ú®
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Continuously monitor user locations with high accuracy.
- **Optimized Routing:** Calculate the best routes in real-time to ensure efficiency.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle multiple users simultaneously, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- **Integration Ready:** Easily integrate with other services like map APIs, payment gateways, etc.

### How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
The Real-Time Location Tracker works by leveraging Node.js with Express, EJS (Embedded JavaScript), and Socket.io to create a server that tracks the user's location in real-time and updates it across the connected clients. Here's how it works:

1. **Server-Side:** The backend server is built using Node.js and Express. It handles incoming requests and serves the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the client.
2. **Real-Time Communication:** Socket.io is used for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients. As the user moves, their location is continuously updated and broadcasted to all connected clients.
3. **Rendering Views:** EJS is used to render dynamic HTML pages, making it easy to display real-time data to users.
4. **Tracking & Updates:** The tracker constantly monitors the user‚Äôs location and updates it on the map, which can be displayed in a web interface.

### Setup Instructions üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Initialize the Project**  
   Open your terminal in Visual Studio Code and run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**  
   Install the necessary packages for your project:
   ```bash
   npm i express ejs
   npm i socket.io
   ```

3. **Start Developing**  
   You're all set! Begin coding your real-time location tracker using Express, EJS, and Socket.io.
